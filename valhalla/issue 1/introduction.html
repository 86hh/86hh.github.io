			<br>Welcome to Valhalla<br>
			
			<br>Three months ago, this was just a simple idea. Tonight I feel there is nothing we can't do. Much has been said that the scene is dying, that there is no coders to research and write the code:<br>
			<br>I see that somewhere in a distant far-off machine cluster in the network, there is someone that's not sleeping.<br>
			<br>I see someone whose mind's cosmos is fitting the ritual, seizing the light of Selene, or victorious over the sun.<br>
			<br>I see the virus writing is alive.<br>
